# ML-OPS Task for AIPLANET Internship

## Project Title: Implementing Kubeflow with MLflow for Model Experiment Tracking

## Project Description:

Kubeflow is an open-source platform that makes it easy to deploy and
manage machine learning workflows on Kubernetes. MLflow is another open-source platform
that provides tools for tracking and managing machine learning experiments.
In this project, you will be setting up a Kubeflow cluster and integrating it with MLflow to track
the experiments run on the cluster. You will then use this setup to train and track the
performance of a model on a dataset.
